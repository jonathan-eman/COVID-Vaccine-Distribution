# COVID-Vaccine-Distribution

As part of a course on database design and management, I worked with a team to develop a strategy that the Virginia Department of Health could implement to improve the efficiency of COVID-19 vaccine rollout and design a corresponding database to manage vaccine data. We then posed 6 theoretical questions that could help the VDH better understand where vaccine rollout efforts were lacking and wrote SQL queries to demonstrate how our database could answer the questions.

In this repository, you can find the slide deck that my team presented to our class, as well as the SQL script that creates the database and answers the questions. 

The following questions were answered:
1. How many days will it take to vaccinate 75% of each Health District with one dose?
2. How can the VDH mitigate the risk of letting vaccines expire?
3. How should the vaccine doses be distributed across the health districts in an equitable manner?
4. How does each health district perform compared to the state average in terms of vaccination rates?
5. On a given day, which clinics are expected to have unused vaccines and how many?
6. Is the lack of vaccines or lack of employees at clinics the reason why people are not being vaccinated?
